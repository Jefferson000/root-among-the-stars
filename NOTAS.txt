Play Music when player dies
When player touches an enemy it should enter in chase state, similar to when is attacked

BUGS FOUND:
When attacking and stun almost at the same time it continue with hurtbox activated


Found a bug with pausing the game. Because you paused the game during the level transition, if you pause the game just when triggering level transition it will show pause screen, but the game will not be paused. Fixed it with adding is_transitioning : bool to LevelManager that is set to true and false in load_new_level() function and checking that variable at the beggining of show_pause_menu() function.

And I added file.close() to both save_game() and load_game() just to be sure.

** Music & Audio Manager // E28 // Make a 2D Action & Adventure RPG in Godot 4

Against my better judgement I decided to try and add a reverb effect only to the dungeon area.

In the level script I added a boolean export variable called has_reverb to add a toggle to every level scene, and passed that as an argument into the AudioManager.play_music() function.

Inside the audio manager, I created a var reverb = AudioServer.get_bus_effect(1,0) which you may have to tweak depending on how your Audio tab is set up, but after I had that in the play_music() function I updated the parameters to include has_reverb and at the very top put:
if has_reverb:
    reverb.room_size = 0.8
else:
    reverb.room_size = 0.0

You need to have it at the very top of the function if you want it to apply to specific areas of your map that use the same audio track, otherwise the if statement to check if the track has changed will return before you get to the reverb.

Anyway, that's the best I could get after some experimentation, but if anyone has a better way please let me know.
